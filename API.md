My goal with this file is to make documentation about classes and other whatnot about our app, so we all know what the objectives are.

# Languages

I'm going to suggest that we use python. That way we can loop PyClub into this if we are very crunched on time.
Also it has a lot of libraries to create computer interfaces.

# Libraries

I'm going to suggest we use the following libraries for our project:

- datetime (to record dates of todos and last edits for notes)
- calendar (mostly to display todos. Can generate text-based calendars.)
- time (for time calculations of course)
- tkinter.ttk (I suggest we use tkinter for applications. Specifically, I suggest we use the tkinter.ttk for more functionality.)
- ttkbootstrap (will need to be installed. Makes ttk look pretty, and also has more Widgets. One of its widgets is a date-picker widget, which will save LOTS of time.)

# Challenges that I see coming

## Learning new Languages

Not to single Josh out, but Josh is new to programming. We have 3 good options for programming languages to use, and I'd like to take a look at them

Also, to point out a contradiction, Python and Java are fairly intuitive languages, but they utilize a concept called Object Oriented Programming.
OOP is a concept that can be hard to grasp.

1. Python
-- Pros: Easy to Learn, Libraries
-- Cons: No Bracket Syntax, Object Oriented Programming, we don't all know Python and OOP can be hard to learn

2. Java
-- Pros: Also pretty easy to learn (so I hear)
-- Cons: Verbose, We don't all know Java, Java is harder to setup than Python (in my opinion). Object Oriented Programming is hard to learn

3. HTML, CSS, Javascript
-- Pros: Website! JS doesn't use OOP, it's very functionally based and is also easy to learn.
-- Cons: I (MZ) hate working with HTML and CSS. I'm super inefficient with it.
-- More Cons: To make this app remember notes / todos effectively, we need to setup accounts and setup a server. This is a TON of work and I'm not great at it.
